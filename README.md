# plan_my_meals

Plan My Meals is an Android app built using Flutter.

A typical advice given to people who want to save money: cook more, plan your meals.

A lot of home cooks like me have already got a reasonable set of recipes that 
they cook on regular basis. I don't want plan  
Having a week's view ahead helps with shopping and preparing the ingredients in advance. 

For example:
* I am planning to make bean something tomorrow, I need to soak beans today.
* I am thinking of cooking chicken on Friday evening, that means I need to defrost it on Thursday evening.
* I am thinking of making burgers on Thursday, must buy gherkins during my weekly grocery shopping.

# What is the app supposed to do (this is work in progress)

1. Maintain multiple meal plans, each meal plan covering one week
2. Generate a weekly plan for dinners
   1. Automated generation is semi random, but taking the following into consideration:
      1. Frequency of past cooking of the same meals (e.g. pasta and mince is done more frequently than roast duck legs)
      2. Occasional items from the wishlist/recipes to try
3. Swipe left: to generate a new suggestion for a particular day
4. Allow to adjust specific day plan:
   1. select specific recipe
   2. select "use leftovers"
   3. select "get takeaway"
   4. select "something else (e.g. dine out/travel/visiting family)"
5. Maintain list of recipe names
6. Maintain a wishlist (recipes to try)
